# main.py

`main.py` serves as the entry point for a software project designed to generate content for a card game. This script encompasses a variety of functionalities, including the generation of card sets, individual cards, images for cards, and the full rendering of cards with associated images and text. It is a command-line interface (CLI) application written in Python, utilizing several modules and custom utilities to perform its tasks.

## Overview

The script is structured to handle different actions specified by the user through command-line arguments. These actions include generating a new set of cards, generating individual card suggestions, creating images for these cards, and compiling full card images. The script also supports a comprehensive action that encompasses all the aforementioned tasks.

## Usage

To use `main.py`, a user must invoke the script from the command line with the required action and optional arguments that tailor the generation process. The available actions are:

- `set`: Generate a new set of cards.
- `cards`: Generate individual card suggestions.
- `images`: Create images for the generated cards.
- `full`: Compile full card images with associated text and graphics.
- `all`: Execute all the above actions sequentially.

## Command-Line Arguments

The script accepts several command-line arguments to customize its behavior:

- `action`: The action to be performed by the script.
- `--set-name`: The name of the card set.
- `--set-description`: A description of the card set.
- `--card-names-file`: A file containing card names.
- `--atomic-cards-file`: The path to `AtomicCards.json`.
- `--max-cards-generate`: The maximum number of cards to generate.
- `--set-size`: The size of the card set.
- `--llm-model`: The language model to use for text generation.
- `--graphics-model`: The graphics model to use for image generation.
- `--mse-location`: The location of the Magic Set Editor executable.

## Functions

`main.py` defines several functions to carry out its operations:

- `parse_arguments()`: Parses and returns the command-line arguments.
- `generate_set(args)`: Generates a new set of cards based on the provided arguments.
- `generated_cards_json(args)`: Generates a JSON Lines file with card suggestions and associated data.
- `generated_cards_images(args)`: Creates images for the generated cards.
- `generate_full_card_images(args)`: Renders full card images with text and graphics.
- Additional utility functions support these primary operations.

## Modules and Utilities

The script imports various modules and utilities to assist with its tasks:

- `os`: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
- `argparse`: Parses command-line arguments.
- `json`: Handles JSON data.
- `random`: Generates random selections.
- Custom utilities from the `content_utils` and `graphics_utils` packages are used for content generation and graphic rendering, respectively.
- `mse_gen`: A utility for interacting with the Magic Set Editor software.

## File Structure

`main.py` interacts with a specific file structure, creating and reading from files within a `sets` directory. This directory contains subdirectories for each card set, which in turn include files for set descriptions, card suggestions, stories, and images.

## Integration with Other Tools

The script integrates with external tools and models, such as the Magic Set Editor and various machine learning models for text and image generation, including GPT-3.5 Turbo and DALL-E.

## Conclusion

`main.py` is a comprehensive tool for automating the creation of card game content. It is designed to be extensible and customizable through its use of command-line arguments and modular design. As the project evolves, additional documentation will be provided for the various utilities and modules referenced within the script, such as [art_director](art_director.md), [flavor_writer](flavor_writer.md), [set_gen](set_gen.md), [render_full_card](render_full_card.md), and [mse_gen](mse_gen.md).
