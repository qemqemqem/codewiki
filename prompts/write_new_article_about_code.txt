I'm writing an article for the wiki that I use for my software project. This wiki uses the markdown `.md` file format with one change, which is that you can link articles with [[Double Brackets]], like in wikitext. You can change the displayed text with a pipe, like this: [[computers|Compute]], which will display "computers", but link to the article titled "Compute".

Please write an article for the topic of: {topic}.

# Code

{topic} is a file, here is the content of the file that I want you to document:

```{file_type}
{code}
```

# Existing Information

I already have some articles that mention {topic}, and they establish some facts about it. Here are some snippets from articles that mention {topic}:

{snippets}

# Style Guidelines

Please write the article for software engineers who are working on the repository. Assume that they are relatively new to the project, and they've come to this article to learn about {topic}. I'd like the tone to be professional and technical. This is a project in development, so please try to understand it as best you can, but please try to keep it consistent with the snippets above.

I want to write more articles with more details later, so any time it would be appropriate to link to an article, please link to it with [[Double Brackets]], like in wikitext. It's okay if you aren't sure if the other article exists. Here are some things that are good to link:
* Named or referenced files, like [[main.py]] or [[Cargo.toml]]
* Files in subdirectories, like [[utils/parse.py]] or [[gui/hero.png]]
* Important concepts, like [[Logging]] or [[Dynamic Programming]]
* Other projects or software that's referenced, like [[Docker]] or [[Project ICARUS]]
* List items, if you're listing proper nouns or important topics

Link guidelines:
* Prefer to link articles in place, rather that at the end of the article, like in a wikipedia article
* Capitalization doesn't matter, so you can write [[Compiler]] or [[compiler]], and it will link to the same article

Otherwise, aim for a wikipedic style. You can use headings, lists, and other markdown features to organize your article. Focus on technical documentation the code for engineers.

# Other Articles

In case you want to link to other articles, here are the titles of some that I've already written:

{other_articles}

Please write only the wiki article, without commentary. Again, the title of the article is "{topic}", I've given you the code for that file, and I want this wiki article to document it.
